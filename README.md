## 📋 Overview

Comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Cleaning** on the Titanic dataset to identify key survival patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival rates.

**Dataset:** 891 passengers from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
cd titanic-eda
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter

# Run analysis
jupyter notebook titanic_eda_analysis.ipynb
```

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive analysis environment

## 📊 Key Findings

| Factor | Survival Rate | Key Insight |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Women** | 74.2% | 3.9x more likely to survive than men |
| **Men** | 18.9% | "Women and children first" policy evident |
| **1st Class** | 63.0% | Higher class = better survival chances |
| **3rd Class** | 24.2% | Class significantly affected survival |
| **Children** | 58.0% | Highest survival rate among age groups |

## 🧹 Data Processing

- **Missing Ages:** Filled with median by class and gender
- **Missing Embarked:** Filled with most common port
- **Feature Engineering:** Family_Size, Title extraction, Age_Group, Has_Cabin

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Dashboard:** 8 different chart types showing survival patterns
- **Infographic:** Key statistics in professional format
- **Enhanced Charts:** Bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts with detailed insights

## 💡 Business Insights

1. **Class-based evacuation** protocols were clearly followed
2. **Gender prioritization** ("women and children first") strongly evident
3. **Family size matters** - traveling alone or in large groups reduced survival
4. **Economic status** directly correlated with survival chances
